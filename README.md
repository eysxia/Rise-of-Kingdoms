## Disclaimers:
1. This MAY NOT work on some computers due to screen sizes, or game being in a different language. I suggest keeping your game in english, keeping your game window the size it is when you first download it, or reuploading the images if neeeded.
2. I was orginally going to add more features and rework some current ones, but i changed my mind since i dont play anymore. This may change in the future though.
3. Im not sure if this is bannable, so use at your own risk.
