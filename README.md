A bot for Rise of Kingdoms to automatically do in-game task for you.

- Python Libraries:
  - pillow

## Notes:
1. If you use the "Auto Scout" feature, please send all you scouts out to explore before-hand for it to work properly.
2. The "Train Troops" feature only retrains troops, meaning the "Gather Troops" feature must be activated aswell.

## Disclaimers:
1. This MAY NOT work on some computers due to screen sizes, or game being in a different language. I suggest keeping your game in english, keeping your game window the size it is when you first download it, or reuploading the images if neeeded.
2. This bot/tool isn't fully completed, and may never be.
3. Im not sure if this is bannable, so use at your own risk.
